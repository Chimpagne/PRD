## Analysis of the situation

Currently, all EPFL services are managed separately. Therefore, as a student at EPFL, I have to go to one portal to see my grades, a different one to find out the menu, and yet another one to look at events happening on campus or access the library.

None of these services are available on a mobile phone; in fact, most EPFL websites do not support modern standards of web responsiveness, and are very difficult to access from a mobile device. This makes navigating campus life at EPFL very hard and time-consuming for me as I am already overburdened with academic load.

## The value proposition

To remedy the situation, PocketCampus offers an all-in-one mobile app to access campus resources. This creates incentive for return users since they no longer have to go to multiple portals and login multiple times to access resources. The app developed as a POC, i.e., during the class project, resonated with students, who will be the primary target user base.

While students are the users, the EPFL administration is the customer. For EPFL as the customer, PocketCampus offers the following value proposition:

- As a leading technological institution, this provides EPFL with a modern, mobile-only all-in-one platform that is very broadly used and deployed among the student population, with the ultimate goal to have most students be monthly active users of the application.
- The extensible design enables a jointly agreed-upon feature roadmap, including features that only make sense on a mobile phone (e.g. that depend on localization) and features that replace mature software (e.g., IS-Academia for the release of grades, etc). This design will provide EPFL management the flexibility to deploy new services on the mobile platform.
- PocketCampus operates the service as a turn-key solution; it handles break fixes resulting from planned and unplanned changes in the EPFL websites during the year according to an annual service-level agreement.

PocketCampus offers a clear benefit to EPFL because it addresses a key pain point of the student experience.

PocketCampus is delivered as "mobile software as a service" to EPFL. This arrangement is convenient to EPFL, which currently lacks the technical expertise and human resources to operate a mobile service. It provides a way to get started. As the relevance of PocketCampus grows, we need to ensure that we are also relevant and important to the EPFL IT technical teams, so that content is ideally exposed via API rather than having to scrape constantly-moving websites.

By operating the service, we will gain insights into which features are most useful and relevant, and gather metrics that will facilitate the renewal of the contract.

The pricing model is to-be-determined, based on discussion with EPFL IT, it might be:

- An annual commitment for the operation of the service itself (support cost, etc)
- (if needed) an additional commitment to support some particularly expensive features that require constant updates.
- A development fee for new services based on a jointly-approved roadmap.
