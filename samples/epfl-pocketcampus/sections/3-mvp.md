### The MVP

The PocketCampus MVP aims to bring a few of EPFL's most used resources under one roof to meet the value proposition identified above. High user retention will serve as a key metric to landing EPFL administration as a customer. We identify ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles) below and list the set of features that we think are used enough to generate repeat traffic.

Concretely, we aim to integrate the following EPFL services into PocketCampus:

1. **Food Menu** - This is the easiest to do and is appealing to all users. Additionally, if a user is signed in we can highlight their meal price instead of the guest price.
2. **Printing** - an out-of-the-box printer configuration brings massive convenience to users. Provides an easy way to submit print jobs to EPFL's myPrint service.
3. **Moodle** - Tracking and managing course deadlines and accessing course content is the primary function of every student and teaching staff at EPFL.
4. **Camipro** - As a seamless method of payment, accepted by all retailers on EPFL campus, managing camipro balance is an excellent feature to simplify.
5. **News** - Integrating the EPFL news bulletin into the MVP enhances the visibility of EPFL's achievements. Moreover, being an authless feature, it can be shown to visitors and non-EPFL members as well.

## Personas and Scenarios

#### User Stories for all EPFL Citizens (students, employees, professors)

1. "As an EPFL citizen, I want to easily access the campus food menu to make informed meal choices."
2. "As an EPFL citizen, I want to be able to quickly send documents from printing right from my phone to EPFL's myPrint service in a few clicks."
3. "As an EPFL citizen, I want to easily be able to view and recharge my camipro account within a few clicks."

#### User Stories for Students only

1. "As a student at EPFL, I want to easily view my class schedule so that I can manage my time efficiently."
2. "As a student, I want to view course announcements, handouts, and deadlines all in one place on my phone."

#### User Stories for Professors (later)

1. "As a professor at EPFL, I want my students to promptly follow updates on Moodle to ensure they are well informed and up-to-date with course requirements."

#### User Stories for EPFL Visitors (later)

1. "As a parent of a prospective student, I want to easily access the latest news and updates about EPFL's activities and achievements, so that I can stay informed about the new and exciting developments at the university, helping me understand the environment and opportunities it offers to its students."

## Success Criteria

#### User Adoption and Engagement

- Target to onboard at least 10% of the campus population (1,000 users) within the first month of launch.
- Achieve a DAU of 10% (100 users) and MAU of 70% (700 users) in the same month.
- Achieve a retention rate of at least 60% in the following month.

#### Feedback and Satisfaction

- Achieve a minimum average rating of 4 out of 5 stars on app stores within the first two months of launch.
- Conduct monthly surveys to gather user feedback, aiming for at least 80% positive feedback regarding app usefulness and user experience.
- Implement at least half of the user-requested features or improvements within two weeks following each feedback survey. Promptly responding to user requests not only demonstrates our commitment to continuously enhancing the user experience but also significantly contributes to building and maintaining user trust in our platform.

#### Commitment from EPFL IT

- Engage with EPFL IT at the executive level without delay
- Discuss terms for first contact before the user adoption criteria are met, conditional on their achievement.

## Features out (Roadmap)

#### Exclusion of ISA Integration

The MVP of PocketCampus will not include integration with EPFL's ISA grade management system. This decision is primarily due to concerns about overloading the ISA service, as simultaneous access of grades from both ISA and our app could lead to extraneous traffic and system strain. This may prompt EPFL to blacklist our service. Additionally, integrating sensitive data requires a comprehensive compliance framework for data privacy and security in agreement with EPFL administration, which is beyond the scope of our initial rollout.

#### Exclusion of Parking Services

Parking services will be excluded from the MVP due to the potentially dynamic nature of EPFL's parking policies. Immediate and accurate updates for parking are crucial to avoid misinformation, which could potentially lead to fines or other issues for users. To maintain the app's reliability and reputation, we have decided not to include parking services until we can ensure real-time accuracy in reflecting policy changes.
