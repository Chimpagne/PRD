# Business Model

## Expected Operating Costs

- **Server Hosting**: Costs associated with hosting our app on cloud servers.

- **Android App Store Fees**: Fees for listing the app on the Google Play Store.

- **Team Salaries**: Compensation for Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and Developers maintaining and improving the app.

## Revenue Streams

- **In-App Advertising**: Revenue generated from displaying ads within the app.

- **Event Sponsorships**: Funds from sponsors who want to promote their events through our app. This includes better positioning in the feed, e.g. showing as the first result in the feed

- **Partnership Deals**: Income from partnerships with businesses renting out beds, delivering food, and providing other supplies.

- **Ticket Sales**: Revenue from tickets sold for events organized through the app.

## Back of the envelope calculations

 - **Event Sponsorships**: Let's assume that the average event organizer creates 14 events (target user 18 to 25 year old, creating 2 big events per year) in their lifetime, with only 75% of events being public, with only 10% of events getting a boost their position on the feed for a price of 5 CHF per day for an on average boosting period of 3 days. The life time value on event sponsorships sales will be of 15.75 CHF.

 - **Partnership Deals**: Let's assume that the average event organizer creates 14 events in their lifetime, with only 3% of events using a partnership deal in which the average sale is of 100 CHF, and that we take a 10% cut. The life time value on partnership deals sales will be of 4.2 CHF.

  - **Ticket Sales**: Let's assume that the average user in their lifetime will go to 10 (paid for entry) events, which costs on average 20 CHF each, and that we take a 7% cut on the sales. The life time value on ticket sales for an user will be of 14 CHF.
