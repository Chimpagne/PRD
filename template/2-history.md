*Describe the V1 POC as planned by Sprint10.*

The V1 POC allows for the creation of an event, for this event to be discovered (via the feed or with the "discover event" screen) and for the event to be joined.

The V1 POC has a strong emphasis on logistics : the event organizer can give roles to guests, setting them as staff member. On event creation, the event organizer can create a list of supplies to bring (later on the organizer can assign supplies to guests). The event organizer can also indicate how many beds are available for a sleepover, and how many parking spaces are available.
When creating an event, the event start and end time, as well as the event location are registered. These infos are used throughout the app to show upcoming events, and search events on a map.

*What did you learn?*

It's hard to have a lot of logistics informations, without adding too much friction to the event creation workflow. It was hard to decide which information should be required when creating an event.
We also learn that the way users search for an event on a map is very different from one user to another. It's difficult to make the search process acceptable to everyone. We needed to enable a specific search without over-conditioning the user.

*What is missing to bridge from PoC to MVP?*

When going from PoC to MVP, we would need to build a proper backend, to allow for more complex functionnalities like proper sanitizazion of user inputs, reminders notifications, security...
