# User Analytics and Acceptance
Before the full rollout of the MVP, we must implement a comprehensive pipeline to collect and analyze user data. This will enable us to identify areas for improvement, fix bugs, and optimize the user experience. Tracking the following metrics and leveraging various analytical tools will be crucial in finding Product-Market Fit (PMF) and ensuring the app meets user needs effectively.

*Goal: understand how users are using the app.*

Our primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of how users interact with Chimpagne. By meticulously tracking user behavior, such as the frequency of app use, session duration, navigation patterns, and feature engagement, we can identify which aspects of the app are most valuable to users and which areas may need improvement. This comprehensive insight will enable us to refine the user experience, address pain points, and ensure that the app effectively meets the needs and expectations of our users, ultimately driving higher satisfaction and retention rates.


*Which are the key metrics?*

- **User Engagement**: Track the frequency of app use, session duration, and navigation paths to understand how users interact with Chimpagne. This will help us identify the most and least engaging parts of the app.

- **Feature Use**: Monitor the number of accesses to key features such as organizing and joining events, discovering events, staff management, polls and voting, supply management (etc...). Understanding which features are most popular will guide future development efforts.

- **Conversion Rates**: Measure the conversion rates from app download to active usage. This will help us determine the effectiveness of our onboarding process and identify any barriers to entry.

- **User Retention**: Analyze the rate of returning users over time to assess the app's ability to retain users. High retention rates are indicative of a valuable and engaging app experience.

- **Drop-off Rate**: Identify which UI transitions have high drop-off rates to pinpoint areas where users may be experiencing frustration or confusion.


*What is the success criteria?*

- **High User Engagement and Retention Rates**: Aim for more than 70% returning users, indicating strong user loyalty and satisfaction.
- **Low Crash Rates and Quick Issue Resolution**: Ensure the app maintains stability with minimal crashes and that any identified issues are resolved promptly.


*What is the analysis plan (link to data collection)?*

- **Behavioral Tracking**: Implement Google Analytics to track user behavior, including interaction patterns and feature usage. This data will provide insights into how users navigate and utilize the app.

- **Stability Monitoring**: Use Firebase Crashlytics to monitor app stability and quickly address any crashes or errors that occur. This will help maintain a smooth and reliable user experience.

- **Data Anonymization**: Anonymize user data to comply with privacy standards, ensuring user information is protected while still gathering valuable insights.


*Include relevant A/B testing ideas.*

- **Navigation Flows**: Test different navigation flows to identify the most user-friendly layout. This will help optimize the app's usability and ensure users can easily access the features they need.

- **Feature Display Formats**: Experiment with various formats for displaying key features, such as the discovering of events page, the different panels to create an event, the supply/staff management interfaces, event invitations (etc...). This will help determine the most effective ways to present information and engage users.
